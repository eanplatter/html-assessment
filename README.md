###HTML & CSS Assessment.



For this week's assessment we will be building the interface to a todo list app called **listo**. 

listo is a neat todo list app that allows users to create multiple lists, and allows list items to move through a process of being **new**, **in progress**, and **archived**.

Follow the interface as closely as possible, as you will be critiqued on accuracy. 

Fork this repo and clone it down into your computer. You will find your index.html and style.css files are included, along with a .png file of how the interface should look. 

### You will need to:
<ul>
<li>Set up and link your html and css files together</li>
<li>Build the interface as it looks in the .png file</li>
<li>commit your changes and push them to GitHub</li>
</ul>

No outside libraries are permitted for this project.
